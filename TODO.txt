SPIKE Nexus:
1. SPIKE Keep cashes the root key.
2. SPIKE Nexus reaches out to SPIKE keep if it does not have the root key.
3. SPIKE Nexus tries to reach out to SPIKE keep with exponential backoff.
4. If SPIKE Nexus is initialized, it does not re-init w/o manual intervention.
5. Initialization will set a new root key and cache it in SPIKE Keep.
