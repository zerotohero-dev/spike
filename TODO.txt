Things to Ensure:

// Things to check to validate that SPIKE functions as intended,
// so that we can add further features on top of the initial building blocks.

SPIKE Nexus:
1. SPIKE Keep cashes the root key.
2. SPIKE Nexus reaches out to SPIKE keep if it does not have the root key.
3. SPIKE Nexus tries to reach out to SPIKE keep with exponential backoff.
4. If SPIKE Nexus is initialized, it does not re-init w/o manual intervention.
5. Initialization will set a new root key and cache it in SPIKE Keep.

SPIKE Pilot:
1. SPIKE pilot to deny any operation without initialization.
2. Ability to set a secret using SPIKE pilot.
3. Ability to read the secret using SPIKE pilot.

SPIKE Keep:
1. Ensure that the root key is stored in SPIKE keep's memory.
2. Ensure that SPIKE keep returns root key back to SPIKE Nexus.

* Assign secrets to SPIFFE ID prefixes.
