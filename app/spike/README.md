## SPIKE Pilot

**SPIKE Pilot** is the command-line interface for the **SPIKE** system.

It's a binary named `spike`.

It's helpful to define an alias to `spike` for ease-of-use:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

# Define an alias to where your `spike` binary is:
alias spike=$HOME/WORKSPACE/spike-git-repo/spike
```
